# Tripwire-Alarm-Security-System-Using-Arduino

## About

This project models a security system. When an intruder walks through the beam, the light source to the LDR is interrupted causing the buzzer to go off, alerting people nearby. Pressing the switch deactivates and resets the alarm, which can then be reactivated by setting the laser or light source back into position.
